So far, as of the time of this update, we have two methods of word doc delivery:
 - EXE encoded as certutil payload pasted in the document.
 - Download a file from a staging location and run it.

The certutil approach only works for small payloads, so for larger installers use the download and run approach. No notes yet on detectability of either option.

Use only for legal and ethical red/purple team testing scenarios.
