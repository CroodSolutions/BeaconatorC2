At some point we will build out some more detailed testing notes on this delivery mechanism. While we have not tested it yet, some of these use cases that are multi-file or that would get caught with email or cloud storage anti-malware products (sandboxes or even filters on file type), use of a vmdk, zip, or other method of nesting files would be good to integrate into testing. IMHO, adversary emulation is only meaningful if we study recent trends, consider the full implications, and consider how we would combine the various lego pieces that make up an attack strategy. While atomic testing is essential, the primary structure of this project, and the only place to start... we also have to remember that real adversaries are going to chain the most effective set of tactics they can find together to thread their way through the defenses of an organization.
