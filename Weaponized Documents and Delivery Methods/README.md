In this project, our primary focus is on creating some atomic test scripts to validate your controls and detection logic, against various remote management/remote access abuse scenarios. However, for red/purple teams, if you want to be realistic it is sometimes useful to explore end-to-end kill chains, going from delivery through to impact. For this reason, we have included some various delivery mechanisms you can explore and test, along with cross-references to other projects that can be combined with AutoRMM for a more comprehensive set of assessments.  

At the time of this writing, we have not tested these maldoc deliveries with AV/EDR/Sandbox products. We are sharing them to enrich testing and improve testing options, but millage may vary.  

Use these tools only for legal and ethical red/purple team testing.
