We have worked on a variety of approaches for weaponized document delivery, along with other methods of delivering Beaconator payloads. It has been our observation that initial access is an area where a lot of testing skips over; as such, we have been working to create options for a more realistic adversary emulation experience.  

Note that some delivery methods, work better with small payloads, in particular when looking across our different tools. For example, dropping a cert util encoded payload into a spreadsheet as an Active-X module may work well for a simple beacon, but it will not work as well for a huge remote management tool installer or even a large full-featured beacon payload.  Sometimes a maldoc approach can deliver a small lightweight payload, which then can be used as the basis to pull down and run a full agent. 

It is our belief that by achieving more realistic adversary emulation, we will improve overall readiness and defensive capability levels.  

Important note: only use Beaconator and the associated tools and techniques for legal and ethical training and testing purposes.
