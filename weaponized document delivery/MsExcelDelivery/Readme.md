---Summary---

This script is to setup a weaponized document attack simulation, using AHK, a certificate file hiding executables, orchestrated by a VBA script to hide a self-contained attack within a single Excel document. Setup steps include creating a lure spreadsheet with two ActiveX objects, each in different tabs (that you will later hide).  In one object/tab you will paste the text of a certutil encoded version of AutoHotKey64.exe and in the other you will paste the text for the an AHK version of a script in AutoRMM. With proper setup, this will allow for a document that runs a macro on-open that will write the AutoHotKey64.exe file to the current working as a pem file, then rename it as AutoHotKey64.exe, followed by wrtiting your AHK AutoRMM script to the current working directory, and then run it using the AHK exe. From this point, it will behave as you would expect according to the specific AHK script selected (any limitations specified in each Readme.md would apply).   

---Setup Steps---

 - Create the lure document.
 - Create two blank tabs and name them.
 - Enable developer tab on the ribbon.
 - Add ActiveX text box on each tab.
 - Download the AutoHotkey64.exe file.
 - Use certutil - encode to create a cert file text version of this exe.
 - Paste this into one of the ActiveX objects in the speadsheet.
 - Retrieve the most recent version of the AutoPwnKey agent from this repo.
 - Paste it into the other ActiveX object.
 - Align naming between the VBA script provided and your lure doc; they are probably not the same out of the box.
 - QA it on a VM running MS Excel.
 - Create your campaign including your email send server, domain, and message/lure.
 - Send / monitor.
 - Monitor the C2 module / server for connections.

Note that there are limitations to how large a payload you can include within an Active-X object, if not from an absolute perspective, certainly from a practical standpoint.
