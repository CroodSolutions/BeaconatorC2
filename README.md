# BeaconatorC2

## --- Introduction ---

BeaconatorC2 was spawned out of several other research initiatives surrounding EDR evasion, LOLBINs, Escape to host flaws, and particularly scripting languages with portable interpreters like AutoIt and AutoHotkey. What we needed was a quick and easy process to setup beacons in restrictive or poorly documented languages and environments, such as WWB-COM, or AIX mainframes. We made BeaconatorC2 to fill that gap, providing a simple and modular communication standard and management application to support any type of beacon. This way, once we find new paths for execution, we can quickly build supported beacons for additional exploitation.

## --- Ethical Standards / Code of Conduct ---

This project has been started to help better test products, configurations, detection engineering, and overall security posture against a series of techniques that are being actively used in the wild by adversaries. We can only be successful at properly defending against evasive tactics, if we have the tools and resources to replicate the approaches being used by adversaries in an effective manner. Participation in this project and/or use of these tools implies good intent to use these tools ethically to help better protect/defend, as well as an intent to follow all applicable laws and standards associated with the industry. The views expressed as part of this project are the views of the individual contributors, and do not reflect the views of our employer(s) or any affiliated organization(s).  

## --- Instructions and Overview ---

TBD

## --- How to Contribute ---

We welcome and encourage contributions, participation, and feedback - as long as all participation is legal and ethical in nature. Please develop new scripts, contribute ideas, improve the scripts that we have created. The goal of this project is to come up with a robust testing framework that is available to red/blue/purple teams for assessment purposes, with the hope that one day we can archive this project because improvements to detection logic make this attack vector irrelevant.
